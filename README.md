## 🧠 ML Architecture & Validation

KISAN-VISION includes a satellite-driven machine learning layer for two tasks:

1. Crop-type classification from NDVI time-series and seasonal context.
2. Phenology-stage estimation for growth-stage mapping.

### Model pipeline
- Feature extraction from Sentinel-2-derived NDVI/NDWI/EVI/SAVI and seasonal metadata.
- Lightweight multiclass classifier trained on synthetic but structured NDVI profiles.
- Inference exposed through the satellite analysis route for live advisory generation.
- Fallback heuristic logic preserved so the experience remains robust even when model weights are unavailable.

### Validation protocol
- Held-out validation using an 80/20 split on class-balanced synthetic samples.
- Reported metrics include accuracy, macro-F1, and top-3 accuracy.
- Validation artifacts are stored in [server/ml/validationReport.json](server/ml/validationReport.json).

### Current validation metrics
- Crop classification: accuracy 0.1667, macro-F1 0.0836, top-3 accuracy 0.5972
- Phenology stage mapping: accuracy 0.6150, macro-F1 0.5006, top-3 accuracy 1.0000

> These numbers should be presented as a prototype validation baseline rather than a field-deployed production benchmark. The next step is to replace the synthetic training set with field-labeled data from agronomists and satellite observations.
